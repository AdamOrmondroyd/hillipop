**High-L Likelihood Polarized for Planck**

HiLLiPoP has been used as an alternative to the public Planck likelihood in the 2013 and 2015 Planck releases [[Planck Collaboration XV 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5075); [Planck Collaboration XI 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02704)], and is described in detail in [[Couchot et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09730)].

This is the cosmological likelihood used in [] and []
Hillipop is a spectra-based Gaussian-approximated likelihood with foreground models for cross-correlation spectra from Planck 100, 143 and 217GHz split-frequency maps
